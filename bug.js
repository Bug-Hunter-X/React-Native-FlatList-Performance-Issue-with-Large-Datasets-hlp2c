This error occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native with a large dataset.  The issue is that React Native tries to render all the items at once, which can lead to memory issues and performance problems. The following code demonstrates the problem: 
```javascript
<FlatList
  data={largeDataset}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.text}</Text> } 
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
/>
```

This code will render all items in `largeDataset`, potentially causing the app to crash or become unresponsive.
